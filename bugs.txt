BUG BUG BUG!!!!

mp3gain <opts> temporary-copy-of-file
mp3gain -s c temporary-copy-of-file
Applying this gives the wrong results from -s c!  Too low results - all around 0.05 or something
Note that MP3s that are silent in rhythmbox are the same ones that have correct tagging with decibel suffix included  .  So other players must discard the RG info on encountering a malformed tag whereas RB stupidly decides to apply them anyway.

WISHLIST

- Ogg support
- M3U playlist creator

BUGS

- Currently naturalized MP3s are silent when played in Rhythmbox
- Error messages should look nicer.
- Passing no files should display the usage message

OPTIMIZE

- There are a large number of instances where we cdr down a list redundantly.
- We save the tag even when we don't need to read from it, mutilating
  mtimes unnecessarily.

 - Replaygain causes files to be silent.
     It is apply-text-tags function that causes it.
    Tracks created as such are silent in rhythmbox.
     They decode with madplay to a WAV that will then play in
     any app, however peak level for madplay is always 0.
     xxd shows that all content is still present.
     So far, this happens on VBR and CBR 320kbps MP3s
     MP3 doesn't matter.  The second you add these tags, it breaks RB.
     Switching tracks & removing from the database and readding doesn't fix
     either.  It's required to restart RB and re-add the file after
     removing the tags.   - only sometimes.
     Adding just track tags doesn't break MP3s.
       -- Actually, yes it does.  Adding only album tags breaks too.
  CONCLUSION:
    This looks an awful lot like a bug in RB.
    Unfortunately it ain't easy to test, but Audacious eats the generated
    mp3s fine, and madplay decodes them fine too.
    I believe rockbox plays them too, since that solid paranoid crap worked.
  FREAKY THING:
   Boom MP3s still work!  Even tho they have tags!  And they STILL WORK
   FINE, every single one.  MADNESS.
