ANANKASM
--------

"Do you have an expansive collection of 90's era experimental
polka rivaling only museums? How do you keep it tidy? Chances
are, it involves a considerable amount of hand-editing, a
smidgen of bash, or a smattering of expletives to complete --
and who has time for all of it anyway?" - Cowbell project.

Answer = me.


OGG SUPPORT
-----------
Oggs currently work 90%, the only missing thing is
ReplayGain.  You can easily apply RG to Vorbis post facto like so:

  vorbisgain -a ~/music/ikonika/2008-millie-direct/*.ogg


HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
Anankasm uses abcde as its backend for the 'anankasm rip' command.
abcde is currently maintained by Jesus Climent, a Debian developer.
The non-Debian abcde site is dead at this point, and so is the SVN.
According to the Debian bug tracker, the SVN contains bugfixes which
have not been applied to the Debian packages.  Given that the same
abcde version is current for both stable, testing, and unstable, it
doesn't seem unfair to say that these patches are unlikely to be
applied in the near future, and that development has stalled.  This is
not problematic in itself, since abcde has very few bugs.  However,
the SVN apparently contains a fix for bug #415365, which anankasm
depends on.  As a result, anankasm bundles a version of abcde which is
pre-patched for this problem.  It will not conflict with the installed
Debian abcde.  If you wish to patch your abcde, the patch is included
in the Anankasm distribution.
