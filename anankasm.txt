"Do you have an expansive collection of 90's era experimental
polka rivaling only museums? How do you keep it tidy? Chances
are, it involves a considerable amount of hand-editing, a
smidgen of bash, or a smattering of expletives to complete --
and who has time for all of it anyway?" - Cowbell project.
